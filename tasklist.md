- [ ] update extractor to write the '.h' files in ./extracted_headers (datatypes does it now - lib-functions ... if a line starts with void and ends with a semicolon that is the line we need - then only getting rid of all 'constant's is the only think we need to do)
- [ ] update the installer script to be universal.. assumes anaconda environments at present
- [ ] compile the binaries on windows for multiplatform testing
- [ ] compile the binaries on mac for multiplatform testing
- [ ] keep upgrading localization.py for multiplatform
- [ ] add proof of concept for retrieving listing from network
