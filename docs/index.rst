pySafe
=======

python interface for the C FFI API of the SAFE Network (www.maidsafe.net)

contributors: rid-dim, duncankushnir

The design goal of pySafe is to provide a full python interface to SAFE network, via the SAFE binaries.

The package (will) include an importable and installable module, as well as utilities to generate the bindings and hopefully eventually some example applications beyond 'hello world'.

Designed to be minimally dependent; only cffi is not included in the base python install.  We do however use features that currently require python 3.6+ . With enough interest, we could probably back port it, but this will depend on our chosen asynchronous implementation.

Currently in development, so it is quite raw.




- On linux, running upg_local.sh will pip update your local environment to the current pySafe state (any python prog can import pySafe, sym-linked to the development directory):

- sh ./upg_local.sh

- On Windows: upg_local.bat (note that at present you will have to compile your own binaries.  Windows support is a ways off yet)

Tests
=======

Automatic tests are run through travis-ci and appveyor on windows, osx and linux

To add tests the test files that are meant to be executed need to be added
to the tests_ directory and need to start with **test_**\* or end with ***_test**

.. _tests: https://github.com/rid-dim/pySafe/tree/dev/tests


.. rubric:: tests to be executed

the test functions that are meant to be executed must be named **test_**\* and need to include an **assert** at the end

.. code-block:: python

    # super simple first test
    def test_answers():
        assert inc(4) == 5
